***Personal Project*** *, Spring 2020*

I used [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to aggregate and display news articles. This webapp supports two types of searches, keyword or categorical. Articles are displayed in a list with summarizing details and an estimated reading time. This project is built with Angular and [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) framework.

** News API no longer allows free searches on the developer plan for hosted websites, please see the [README](https://github.com/annagriffin/news-api-app) on Github to see screenshots
