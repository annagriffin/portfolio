***Computer Architecture*** *, Fall 2019*

For our final project I designed an implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Verilog with one other student. Our version is able to encrypt and decrypt messaged and utilizes a 128-bit cypher block. We learned about this standard and its real life applications. This was a great opportunity to use the principles of computer architecture that we had studied throughout the course.
