***A Computational Introduction to Robotics****, Fall 2020*

Explored the role of computer vision in the field of robotics by creating a contour tracing robot in [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/). We extracted a contour from an image then converted the contour to a set of waypoints that the robot could interpret and follow. We implemented our own contour detection algorithm and reordering method to find the important waypoints and establish a path.
