***Linearity I****, Spring 2018*

Co-authored a paper explaining a JPEG compression using DCT and Huffman Encoding. To accompany our report, we implemented a python script to perform the compression described in our paper which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/annagriffin/JPEGcompression).
